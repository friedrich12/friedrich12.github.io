      <description>Private messaging over internet related services is difficult to implement. Regular end-to-end encryption messaging systems are prone to man in the middle attacks and only hide messages but not the identity of its users. For example, WhatsApp offers a strong privacy guarantee but does not hide much Metadata because it uses end-to-end encryption. Other messaging systems such as Skype can be monitored by government agencies and have backdoors implemented into its software.</description>

      <description>Why do we need paging? In operating systems paging is used to elimiate the need for contigous physical memory. By using virtual memory with paging we can use blocks in the computer&amp;rsquo;s physical memory instead of using a contigous section. But still why does this matter?
Just look at figure 1. If we only use contingous blocks of memory we might be taking away memory that can be used to run other programs.</description>
